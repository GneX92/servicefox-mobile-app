## Root / Configuration Files

### `package.json` (Score: 8.2)
**Strengths**
- Clear separation of deps vs devDeps.
- Uses Expo SDK 54 with React 19 & React Native 0.81 (new architecture enabled elsewhere) – up‑to‑date.
- Jest configured with `jest-expo` preset.
- Strict TypeScript enabled via base tsconfig.
**Issues / Risks**
1. (M/BP) No scripts for type checking (`tsc --noEmit`) or lint fix automation.
2. (L/DX) No `precommit`/`lint-staged` integration to enforce quality.
3. (M/Sec) No `npm audit` / dependency vulnerability scan automation.
4. (L/Perf) Potentially unused packages (manual audit recommended) – e.g., `react-native-worklets` if not applied.
5. (M/BP) Missing explicit `engines` field to lock Node version (reproducibility).
**Recommendations**
- Add scripts: `"typecheck": "tsc --noEmit"`, `"lint:fix": "eslint . --fix"`.
- Introduce Husky + lint-staged for staged file checks.
- Add GitHub Action / CI pipeline with `audit --production` or use Dependabot.
- Define `engines.node` and `packageManager` (e.g., `pnpm` or `npm` version) for deterministic environments.
- Run dep analyzer to prune unused modules.

### `tsconfig.json` (Score: 8.8)
**Strengths**
- Extends Expo base; uses `strict: true`.
- Path alias `@/*` simplifies imports.
**Issues**
1. (L/DX) Missing incremental build options (`"incremental": true`) for faster local TS builds.
2. (L/BP) Might benefit from `skipLibCheck: true` for RN performance (tradeoff), if build times high.
3. (L/BP) No `noErrorTruncation: true` (optional) – helps CI debugging.
**Recommendations**
- Evaluate adding `"incremental": true`, and optionally `"noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true` for safer indexing.
- Consider adding a `types` array if global ambient types grow.

### `tailwind.config.js` (Score: 7.9)
**Strengths**
- Organized color tokens using CSS variables with `<alpha-value>` pattern – themeable.
- Proper `content` globs include app, components, src.
- Uses `safelist` for dynamic color classes.
**Issues**
1. (M/Perf) Very broad safelist regex → can bloat compiled style sheet / runtime class map.
2. (M/BP) `darkMode` configurable via env var – but no documentation on required variable naming; fallback `'class'` okay.
3. (L/DX) Duplicated tokens (e.g., repeating color scales) could be abstracted to reduce maintenance.
4. (L/Perf) Unused font families set to `undefined`; can be omitted.
**Recommendations**
- Narrow safelist pattern or move to explicit enumerations for most used design tokens.
- Document theming strategy in README.
- Remove `undefined` font family placeholders; declare only used fonts.
- Consider splitting color system to a separate `tokens.ts` consumed by multiple layers.

### `app.json` (Score: 7.5)
**Strengths**
- Uses `experiments.reactCompiler` and `typedRoutes` (modern ecosystem features).
- New architecture enabled.
- Android adaptive icon fully specified.
**Issues**
1. (H/Sec) `extra.backendUrl` uses a raw IP with HTTP – risk of MITM; should prefer `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` env-driven config + HTTPS.
2. (M/Sec) Secrets (projectId) in config could be environment-specific; ensure not leaking production identifiers needlessly.
3. (M/BP) Missing iOS `infoPlist` overrides for NSPrivacyUsage (Notifications, etc.) may cause review friction.
4. (L/Perf) No `updates` config; consider OTA update strategy explicitness.
5. (L/UX) `userInterfaceStyle: automatic` fine, but ensure dark theme tokens implemented.
**Recommendations**
- Move `backendUrl` into build-time env (`EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`) or remote config; use HTTPS.
- Add privacy strings for notifications, location if later required.
- Add `ios.buildNumber` and `android.versionCode` tracking release discipline.
- Consider `runtimeVersion` for EAS update targeting.

### `babel.config.js` (Score: 8.0)
**Strengths**
- Caches config; integrates nativewind and reanimated plugin in correct order (reanimated last).
- Module resolver alias simplifies imports.
**Issues**
1. (M/Perf) Could enable `react-compiler` transform once stable (some duplication with Expo experiment).
2. (L/BP) Missing explicit `extensions` and potential platform-specific aliasing guidelines.
3. (L/DX) No doc on alias usage (`@` root) – onboarding friction.
**Recommendations**
- Document alias mapping in README.
- Evaluate adding `plugins: ['module:react-native-dotenv']` (if env var expansions needed) – ensure secure usage.

## Source & Context

### `src/auth/AuthContext.tsx` (Score: 8.6)
**Strengths**
- Robust token refresh logic with in-flight deduplication & scheduling before expiry.
- Graceful fallback on decode errors; minimal global side-effects.
- Proper cleanup of timers, removal of tokens on sign out.
- Abstracted `apiFetch` with 401 retry path.
**Issues**
1. (M/Sec) Access & refresh tokens stored via `SecureStore` (good) but fallback to `localStorage` on web not namespaced or encrypted; consider prefix + expiry metadata.
2. (M/Sec) `decodeJwtExp` does not validate signature (comment acknowledges) – ensure not used for trust decisions (only scheduling) – currently fine; document.
3. (M/Perf) Multiple calls to `getItem` in `apiFetch` retry after refresh; could capture new token from refresh promise result to avoid extra IO.
4. (L/BP) `API_URL` environment var naming mismatch with usage elsewhere (`EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL` vs present?) – potential undefined calls.
5. (L/BP) No network timeout handling – fetch could hang on poor networks.
6. (L/DX) Type duplication for server responses – could centralize in `types/api.ts`.
**Recommendations**
- Add wrapper `fetchWithTimeout` or AbortController with default (e.g., 15s).
- Namespace web storage keys (e.g., `app.auth.accessToken`).
- Provide `onAuthError` callback hook surface for UI-level error boundaries.
- Co-locate response types in shared `auth.types.ts`.

### `src/utils/storage.ts` (Score: 7.8)
**Strengths**
- Sensible fallback logic with error isolation.
- Uses `AFTER_FIRST_UNLOCK_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY` (good security posture vs default).
**Issues**
1. (H/Sec) Silent swallow of all errors might mask data persistence failures; at least log in dev.
2. (M/Sec) No JSON helper (risk of inconsistent serialization scattered elsewhere).
3. (M/BP) No size or quota handling when using localStorage fallback.
4. (L/Sec) Keys not namespaced; risk of collisions and easier enumeration.
**Recommendations**
- Add environment-based logger (dev only) when secure store fails.
- Provide `getJSON/setJSON` helpers with try-catch centralization.
- Prefix all keys: `sfm.` or similar.

### `src/utils/pushNotifications.ts` (Score: 7.4)
**Strengths**
- Careful explanation of pseudo device ID (good transparency / privacy).
- Uses randomized component for uniqueness.
**Issues**
1. (M/Sec) Device ID generation uses `Math.random()` (not cryptographically strong). For uniqueness/local use this is usually fine; doc clarifies but maybe strengthen.
2. (L/BP) No versioning of ID format – future changes could break assumptions.
3. (L/Perf) Each call awaits `getItem`; can cache result in module-level variable.
**Recommendations**
- Consider `crypto.getRandomValues` when available.
- Cache device id in memory to reduce async overhead.
- Add comment on persistence scope and rotation policy.

### `src/utils/registerForPushNotificationsAsync.ts` (Score: 7.6)
**Strengths**
- Proper channel config for Android.
- Graceful logging of missing projectId.
**Issues**
1. (M/UX) Uses `alert` for errors – surface via unified toast / error boundary instead.
2. (L/Sec) No explicit permission rationale message for iOS (handled in app config maybe – ensure Info.plist values present).
3. (M/BP) Function returns `string | undefined` but not typed; lacks TypeScript signature annotation for clarity.
4. (L/Perf) Multiple awaits could be parallelized (permission + projectId retrieval) – minor.
**Recommendations**
- Replace `alert` with context-based UI component.
- Add explicit return type and JSDoc.
- Consolidate permission prompt handling at a higher level if reused.

### `context/NotificationContext.tsx` (Score: 8.1)
**Strengths**
- Structured retry strategy with exponential backoff + max window.
- Separation of registration attempt state for UI.
- Handles app lifecycle events & push listeners with cleanup.
**Issues**
1. (M/Perf) Interval-based retry even if network offline – consider NetInfo integration to pause until connectivity.
2. (M/Sec) Registration calls include deviceId and token; ensure token sanitized (server side). Client side fine.
3. (L/BP) `any` casts for `appointmentId`; infer type or narrow with zod decoder.
4. (L/BP) Hard-coded toast colors/strings not centralized (risk of duplication).
5. (L/Perf) `attemptRegisterWithBackoff` increments `attempts` state inside loop causing many renders; consider local counter then single state update.
**Recommendations**
- Integrate connectivity checks to defer attempts offline.
- Use schema validation for notification payloads.
- Collapse attempt loop state updates with a reducer or batching pattern.

## UI Components

### `components/ui/button/index.tsx` (Score: 8.3)
**Strengths**
- Variant-driven styling via `tva`; context-based composition clean.
- Correct `forwardRef` usage.
- Good separation of text/icon/spinner.
**Issues**
1. (L/Perf) Large static style definitions re-created once (fine) but can export them for re-use/testing.
2. (L/UX) Accessibility: no default `accessibilityRole="button"` on root; Pressable usually OK but explicit role helpful on web.
3. (L/BP) Repetition of classes for variant = could be DRY'ed with token maps.
4. (L/DX) Missing prop docs / JSDoc for design system consumers.
**Recommendations**
- Add doc comments & storybook (if web) or a MDX design tokens doc.
- Provide consistent ARIA roles for web output.

### `components/ui/input/index.tsx` (Score: 8.0)
**Strengths**
- Consistent variant architecture analogous to button.
- Uses style context & properly forwards refs.
**Issues**
1. (L/UX) Missing accessibility labels / roles for icon buttons (when interactive) – though slot semantics vary.
2. (M/BP) Complex tailwind class strings (especially for invalid state) reduce readability; could extract to constants.
3. (L/Sec) No input sanitization (should delegate to validation layer, but note).
**Recommendations**
- Consider helper functions to build variant ring classes.
- Add `accessibilityLabel` to interactive slots (clear / toggle etc.).

### `components/ui/card/index.tsx` (Score: 8.7)
**Strengths**
- Minimal, clean, variant-based.
- Exports typed interface.
**Issues**
1. (L/BP) Lacks elevation tokens doc; ensure accessible contrast for backgrounds.
2. (L/UX) Could accept `accessible` prop to explicitly mark grouped semantics.
**Recommendations**
- Add small JSDoc for variant usages.

### Other UI Components (Alert, Badge, FormControl, Icon, Spinner, Table, Text, Toast etc.) (Score: 7.5 estimate)
**Strengths**
- Likely follow same pattern; consistent naming.
**Issues**
1. (M/BP) Without central theme/types doc, design system scalability risk.
2. (L/Perf) Potential duplication of heavy tva config across components.
**Recommendations**
- Create `design-system.md` summarizing variants, intended usage, accessibility guidelines.

---
## Screens / Routing

### `app/_layout.tsx` (Score: 8.4)
**Strengths**
- Splash screen lifecycle handled with try/catch safeguard.
- Clean separation of `AuthProvider` vs routed content.
**Issues**
1. (L/BP) No suspense boundary for potential lazy route components.
2. (L/Perf) Could delay loading of heavy (app) stack until authenticated with `unstable_settings.initialRouteName` logic.
**Recommendations**
- Consider `<Suspense>` around children for data preloading (once supported adequately in RN 0.81 environment).

### `app/(auth)/_layout.tsx` (Score: 8.0)
**Strengths**
- Redirect logic simple & effect-based.
**Issues**
1. (M/Perf) On every render effect runs (deps OK) but still consider guarding with `if (!session)` early return; minor.
2. (L/Sec) Ensure no flicker reveals auth screens after sign-in (likely minimal).
**Recommendations**
- Provide fade / skeleton transition for improved UX.

### `app/(app)/_layout.tsx` (Score: 7.9)
**Strengths**
- Wraps NotificationProvider logically inside authenticated app.
- Sets global notification handler.
**Issues**
1. (M/Sec) Notification handler suppresses alerts (`shouldShowAlert:false`) while adding custom toast; ensure sensitive data not exposed inadvertently.
2. (L/BP) Inline toast config; extract to `/config/toast.ts` for consistency.
3. (L/Perf) Handler set each layout mount; stable but ensure idempotency.
**Recommendations**
- Document rationale for disabling system alerts (audit requirement).

### `app/(app)/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` (Score: 8.2)
**Strengths**
- Uses custom sign-out tab with accessible Pressable.
**Issues**
1. (M/UX) Pressable sign-out has no accessibility label or confirmation; accidental taps log out user.
2. (L/Sec) Immediate logout may not revoke tokens if network offline (background fetch attempted earlier) – consider optimistic + queue.
**Recommendations**
- Add confirm dialog or long-press for logout.
- Add `accessibilityLabel="Abmelden"`.

### `app/(auth)/login.tsx` (Score: 8.3)
**Strengths**
- Proper secure password field toggle.
- Error state surfaced via Alert.
- Good ref separation between fields.
**Issues**
1. (L/UX) Email validation minimal; could disable submit if invalid format.
2. (L/Sec) Error messages from backend surfaced raw → potential leakage of internal messages.
3. (L/Perf) Large image (300x300) always loaded; consider responsive or caching strategies.
**Recommendations**
- Sanitize backend errors: map to user-friendly messages.
- Add basic email regex or use form validation library.
- Optimize image (webp) or placeholder skeleton.

### `app/(app)/(tabs)/index.tsx` (Appointments list) (Score: 8.0)
**Strengths**
- Efficient list rendering using `LegendList` with recycling and `keyExtractor` fallback logic.
- Date/time formatting localization aware.
- Defensive parsing supporting multiple server payload shapes.
**Issues**
1. (M/BP) Overly permissive fallback parsing – may hide backend contract drift; better to validate and fail distinctly.
2. (M/Perf) Each render defines helper functions inside component (though memoized where needed). Could move pure utilities outside for clarity.
3. (L/Sec) Displaying server data without sanitization (if HTML present in future?) – currently plain text.
4. (L/Perf) Converting dates repeatedly inside `renderItem`; could pre-derive fields when normalizing data.
5. (L/BP) Hard-coded colors in styles – should use theme tokens.
**Recommendations**
- Introduce schema (zod / io-ts) for `Appointment` ingestion.
- Normalize dataset once after fetch.
- Replace magic color strings with tailwind tokens.

### `app/(app)/appointment/[id].tsx` (Detail screen) (Score: 7.7)
**Strengths**
- Defensive error parsing (attempts JSON parse).
- Reusable `Row` component for icon+content alignment.
- Graceful fallback values with `display` helper.
**Issues**
1. (M/Sec) `normalizeDescription` only replaces `<br>`; if server sends HTML, other tags could be injected and displayed raw (XSS risk on web / layout break). Currently stores description raw in `restoredHtml` and renders inside `<Text>` (RN escapes text) – OK unless using rendered HTML components later; document.
2. (M/BP) Many inline styles + color literals reduce theme coherence.
3. (L/Perf) `formatRange` reconstructs dates anew each render; could memoize when dependencies change.
4. (M/BP) Utility functions mixed inside component file; could extract to `appointment.utils.ts` for testability.
5. (L/UX) Lack of loading skeleton (only spinner). Could show placeholder layout to reduce layout shift.
**Recommendations**
- Sanitize or restrict description content – if future HTML support needed, use a safe renderer with whitelist.
- Externalize constants/colors & date helpers.
- Add skeleton placeholders (shimmer) using existing design system components.

## General Cross-Cutting Observations

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Authentication Flow | Good | Refresh management robust; add timeout & error boundary. |
| Token Storage | Moderate | Improve key namespacing & error visibility. |
| Network Layer | Basic | Add centralized API client with interceptors & timeouts. |
| Error Handling | Inconsistent | Mix of `alert`, toast, silent catch; unify strategy. |
| Logging | Minimal | Introduce lightweight logger with env-based verbosity. |
| Theming | Strong foundation | Reduce hard-coded inline colors; extend semantic tokens. |
| Accessibility | Needs iteration | Add roles, labels, focus outlines for interactive elements. |
| Performance | Generally fine | Optimize list item computed fields and reduce repetitive date parsing. |
| Security | Acceptable baseline | Enforce HTTPS, sanitize any rich text, improve storage namespace. |
| Testing | Sparse | No unit tests around auth utils / contexts; only jest preset present. |

## Top 10 Priority Actions (Impact vs Effort)
1. Enforce HTTPS & env-managed `API_URL` (Security).
2. Namespace and document storage keys; add minimal logging of secure store fallback (Security / Maintainability).
3. Add network timeout & abort logic to `apiFetch` (Reliability / UX).
4. Introduce schema validation (zod) for server responses (Security / Data Integrity).
5. Narrow Tailwind safelist regex to reduce bundle/class inflation (Performance).
6. Centralize colors and eliminate inline hex values in screens (Consistency).
7. Add accessibility labels/roles for Pressable components (Accessibility).
8. Replace raw backend error surfacing with user-friendly mapped messages (Security / UX).
9. Implement tests for AuthContext token refresh scheduling and push registration logic (Quality).
10. Create documentation: design system, environment config, notification retry behavior (DX).

---
## Suggested Future Enhancements
- Integrate Sentry or similar for crash & performance tracing.
- Add React Query / TanStack Query for caching and stale management instead of manual fetch + state.
- Consider codegen for API types (OpenAPI) to remove manual typing drift.
- Implement feature flags for experimental UI changes (dark mode toggling etc.).
- Add CI checks: lint, typecheck, unit tests, EAS build dry run.

---
## Summary
Overall the codebase demonstrates solid architectural decisions (context-based auth, retry/backoff strategies, variant-driven UI system). Security posture is reasonable for a client app but should be hardened around transport (HTTPS), storage key namespacing, and response validation. Performance is acceptable; a few micro‑optimizations and bundle hygiene tasks (safelist, repeated date parsing) will improve scalability. The largest maintainability wins will come from centralizing design system docs, normalizing error handling, and introducing schema/type enforcement at boundaries.

If you would like, I can produce targeted patches for any of the above recommendations in follow-up steps.
